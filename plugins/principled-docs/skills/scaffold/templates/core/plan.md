# Plan-{{NUMBER}}: {{TITLE}}

## Objective

<!-- What does this plan accomplish? Link to the originating decision. -->

Implements [ADR-{{ADR_NUMBER}}](../decisions/{{ADR_NUMBER}}-{{ADR_SLUG}}.md).

TODO

## Domain Analysis

### Bounded Contexts

<!-- What are the distinct areas of domain responsibility affected by this work? -->

TODO

### Aggregates

<!-- What are the core domain objects and their boundaries? -->

TODO

### Domain Events

<!-- What events flow between contexts? What state transitions matter? -->

TODO

## Implementation Tasks

<!-- Concrete, ordered tasks derived from the domain analysis. Each task should map to one or more bounded contexts. -->

### Phase 1: TODO
